# Order-billing-in-LINUX
<B>Ten students (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j) are going to attend an event. There are lots of gift shops, they all are going to the gift shops and randomly picking the gifts. After picking the gifts, they are randomly arriving in the billing counter.  The accountant gives the preference to that student who has maximum number of gifts. Create a C or Java program to define order of billed student.</B>

<B>Priority scheduling</B> is a method of scheduling processes based on priority. In this method, the scheduler chooses the tasks to work as per the priority, which is different from other types of scheduling, for example, a simple round robin.

Priority scheduling involves priority assignment to every process, and processes with higher priorities are carried out first, whereas tasks with equal priorities are carried out on a first-come-first-served (FCFS) or round robin basis. An example of a general-priority-scheduling algorithm is the <B>shortest-job-first (SJF)</B> algorithm.

This concept is purely based on priority scheduling with non-preemptive concept. Because according to the 10 students (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j) which one has maximum number of gifts, that student has given highest priority by the accountant and which has minimum has given least priority by the accountant. Suppose, if student A has maximum no of gifts and B has minimum no of gifts then accountant will give first preference to student A and then at last it will give preference to student B. This all move around priority scheduling algorithm.
